\chapter*{Evaluation of Text and Referencing in the Document Provided}
\label{chap1}

The goal of this Activity is to evaluate the text and determine if proper referencing of the sources used has been done. It appears that the main topic addressed is Scene Text Recognition (STR). While reading the document, several issues were found, both with text/language used as well as referencing. The following two sections will take a look at some of these issues. The final section will grade the text out of 100 based on the evaluation. Please refer to the annotated version of the original document (1\_annotated.pdf) in the following sections.

\section*{Evaluation of Text} 
Overall, the language used in the document is not consistent or up to standards for academic audience. The following are some of the issues found in the text:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Clarity and Structure:} Overall, the document lacks cohesion, coherence and, therefore, clarity. 
    \item  \textbf{Redundancies:} The word \textit{text} is repeated many times, and in same cases, within the same sentence. Please refer to 1\_annotated.pdf for a suggested solution. 
    \item  \textbf{Long, Complex sentences:} These types of sentences appear several times within the document and are hard to follow. 
    \item  \textbf{Inadequate Academic Tone:} In a number of cases, the author uses casual tone within senteces, for example, beginning a sentence with "So,...", or "However, there is still so much room". 
\item  \textbf{Insignificant Definitions:} The some definitions given by the author
do not provide any meaningful explanations of the subjecct matter, for example, "Text localization aims to localize text components..." or "Text verification focuses on verifying text..."
\item  \textbf{Superficial Claims and Conclusions:} The author makes strong claims and conclusions about methods and outcomes without citing sources.

\end{itemize}

\section*{Evaluation of Referencing} 
Many of the referencing issues within the text and Bibliography are due to inconsistencies as follows:


\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{In-Text Citations}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Incorrect Order Citations:} The author used a mix of ascending (correct) and descending (incorrect) in-text citation order as in "This idea can be utilized in different computer vision tasks, such as image-based search [1], [2], robots navigation [3], [2] and industrial automation [4], [2]."
 \item \textbf{Citation Redundancy:} The [2] in the above sentence is repeated thrice. This may be due to irrelevant citations, content, or lack of prioritization.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Bibliography}
     \begin{itemize}
 \item \textbf{Inconsistent Formatting of Names:} While entry [1] lists authors with initials followed by last names, entries [2], [3], and [5] use the first name followed by the last name. Additionally, entry [4] combines both cases.
 \item \textbf{Inconsistent Formatting of Publishers:} Entry [1] uses IEEE Computer Society, while entry [3] uses "Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc., USA
    \end{itemize}
 \item \textbf{Inconsistent Page numbers:} Page numbers are either of different format or missing entirely. 
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
